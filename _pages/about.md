Initially trained in Geosciences, I gradually developed a passion for fieldwork and scientific heritage. This led me to specialize in Paleontology. During my Master’s studies at the University of Antananarivo, Madagascar, I actively participated in paleontological excavations while also working in my institution’s research laboratories. One of my most memorable moments was discovering hippopotamus tooth fossils during fieldwork. I will always be grateful to [Dr. Karen Samonds](https://www.sadabe.org/Samonds/Index.html){:target="_blank"} for welcoming me into her team and giving me the chance to take part in her field projects across Madagascar.


My first exposure to Archaeology came in 2019 through the ''[Sacred Rice Archaeological Project](https://sacredriceproject.org/){:target="_blank"}.'' Although it was only a brief, lab-based experience and an extracurricular activity during my paleontology training, it sparked a strong interest in cultural heritage.


After graduating with a Master’s in Paleontological Collections and Conservation, during which I had the opportunity to work on additional hippopotamus tooth fossils collected during fieldwork, I decided to continue my studies in Archaeology at the University of Burgundy in Dijon, France. One distinctive feature of this [Master’s program](https://formations.ube.fr/fr/offre-de-formation/master-XB/master-archeologie-sciences-pour-l-archeologie-LMGC25OB.html){:target="_blank"} was its interdisciplinary approach, which made the transition from a hard sciences background to the humanities and social sciences rather smooth. I had the opportunity to take part in more structured excavations and to visit numerous museums, which helped me appreciate cultural heritage even more.


I have developed a growing interest in 3D reconstructions of ancient remains, but access to technology and training in this field was limited during my academic journey in Madagascar. I was later fortunate to be introduced to this approach in the context of cultural heritage, particularly for archaeological buildings, thanks to [Dr. Olivia Puel](https://www.arar.mom.fr/presentation/annuaire-du-personnel/puel-olivia){:target="_blank"}.


I am genuinely curious about Science in all its forms and enjoy exploring connections between disciplines.


Being on the job market, I am currently seeking roles that allow me to work in the field, in the laboratory, or in a museum--settings where I feel equally engaged and effective.

Research interests
=====
If I have the opportunity to enroll in a research program, I would be excited to explore the following topics:  

-  3D digitization of cultural heritage  
-  3D geometric morphometrics  
-  Virtual museum development and management

I have always been fascinated by dolphins, and I would also love to explore this interest through the lens of my acquired background, should the chance arise.
